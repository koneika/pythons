<P>The d3d9.dll file in this package demonstrates some of 
the software rendering capabilities of swShader. It provides a DirectX 9 
compatible interface to the ShadowVolume application, which is unmodified from 
the DirectX 9.0b SDK. More information about swShader can be found at <A 
href="http://sw-shader.sourceforge.net">http://sw-shader.sourceforge.net</A>. To run this demo, a 
Windows XP compatible operating 
system, and a Pentium III compatible processor are required. Your desktop color depth 
has to be at 32-bit.&nbsp;The DLL has been slightly crippled on purpose 
so it is intended to only be used with the ShadowVolume application. More demos 
can be found at the website.</P>
<P>The DLL is for demonstration purposes only and you&nbsp;can only distribute 
it to others for this purpose. In particular this means no commercial use of the 
DLL is allowed. This software comes without warranty, use it at your own risk.
